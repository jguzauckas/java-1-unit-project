# Project Directions

Starting in the `Assignment.java` file, use print statements to print out a circle made up of lowercase o's. The circle should be empty on the inside and be 12 o's wide for it's diameter. You can decide how many lines tall makes sense for it to look circle-like. Here is an example of a circle that is 8 o's wide:

```
    oooo
   o    o  
  o      o
   o    o
    oooo
```

Initialize variables with the appropriate types for each of the following values:
- `15`
- `false`
- `9.0`
- `-12.2`
- `true`
- `-4`
- `0`
- `100.5`

Using the variables initialized above, print out the following information:
- The sum of `15` and `9.0`.
- The difference of `-12.2` and `9.0`.
- The product of `-4` and `100.5`.
- The quotient of `100.5` and `15`.
- The remainder of the quotient of `15` and `-4`.
- The average of all variables holding numbers.

Modify the variables initialized above following the instructions below, and print out their values after modifying:
- Multiply `15` by `3`.
- Subtract `2.3` from `9.0`.
- Add `4.67` to `-12.2`.
- Divide `-4` by `4`.
- Add `1` to `0`.
- Take the remainder of the quotient of `100.5` and `14.2`.

For each of the decimal variables, print out a rounded integer value from them.

Print out an average of all number variables, except make sure the sum portion is cast to an integer, and then the resulting division is still a decimal.

When you complete all of the above, print out a statement saying `I finished my project Mr. G!`.
